    | For the prototype phase we are using our virtual testcurrency MANGOS to demonstrate the power of a "relative currency", by removing the concept of dept and embracing a universal basic income, inspired by the
    a(href="http://vit.free.fr/TRM/en_US/index.html") Theory of Relative Money.
    | If you want to learn more about the concept of Relative Money and Demurrage Fee get engaged on

    h3 Information & Overview
    | A relative currency is tightly coupled to its members and money distribution is based on the amount of real and unique people in a network of trust, a reason proper identification is indispensable. For simplicity in the beginning, you will be able to get verified by other members and than and verify other people. Make sure to get verified again every 5 years, about every 1 real month. On the long run this will be exchanged with a more complex webOfTrust certification method.

        | Each verified member will receive 24 Mangos per day

        .header Total Amount of Mangos to be generated per Person:
        | Over the course of 40 years the total money supply will stabilize at 87400 Mangos per verified member
      .item
        .header Demurrage Fee: 10%
        |  To encourage spending the mangos, every year 10% of the the total amount of mangos will be rotting again.
      .item
        .header Speed
        |  In this prototype we use for the demonstration purpose a speeding up factor, setting 1min to a 1sec interval. So 5 virtual years is about 1 real month

    h4 And now enjoy giving your Mangos to your friends, before our Bugs are eating them up or even you!
